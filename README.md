# Generating Patient cohorts for 🧪 _Yet Another ICU Benchmark_


This repo uses the `ricu` R package to derive patient cohorts for prediction tasks from the following intensive care databases: 
| **Dataset**                 | [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/) / [IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/) | [eICU-CRD](https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/) | [HiRID](https://physionet.org/content/hirid/1.1.1/) | [AUMCdb](https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-22u-f8vd) |

New datasets can also be added. We are currently working on a package to make this process as smooth as possible.

* [HiRID](https://hirid.intensivecare.ai/)
* [eICU](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/)
* [MIMIC IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/) -->
We provide five common tasks for clinical prediction by default:

| No  | Task                 | Frequency        | Type                                | 
|-----|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | ICU Mortality             | Once per Stay (after 24H) | Binary Classification  |
| 2   | Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) | Hourly (within 6H) | Binary Classification |
| 3   | Sepsis                    | Hourly (within 6H) | Binary Classification |
| 4   | Kidney Function(KF)       | Once per stay | Regression |
| 5   | Length of Stay (LoS)      | Hourly (within 7D) | Regression |

New tasks can be easily added.

## To replicate the cohorts:

Run the following commands to clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/rvandewater/YAIB-cohorts.git
cd YAIB-cohorts
```
Once you have cloned the repo, all cohorts can be created directly from within R or via an interface from python. Instructions for each can be found at: 

- R: [README.md](R/README.md)
- Python: [README.md](Python/README.md)  

Note: due to some recent bug fixes in ricu, the extracted cohorts might differ marginally to those published in the benchmarking paper. 

## Acknowledgements

The code in this repository heavily utilises the `ricu` R package, without which deriving these cohorts would have been much more difficult. If you use the code in this repo, please go give their repo a star :)
